 rating for the app. Also records the fact that this has happened, so the

 The only case where you should call this directly is if your app has an
 explicit "Rate this app" command somewhere.  In all other cases, don't worry
 about calling this -- instead, just call the other functions listed above,
 and let Appirater handle the bookkeeping of deciding when to ask the user
 whether to rate the app.
